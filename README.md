# Refactoring

# Objective:
 Make the website more accessible 
# What was done:
After cloning the resporitory and opening. I inspected the index.html and added comments on what needed to
be added or fixed inorder to enhance the website. I went and fixed the heading tags to make sure they were in the correct order. The images needed an alt element to describe the content of the images, so that was added. Overall code was put into a cleaner layout by using semantic elements like main to group the content of the website together and differentiate between the 'header and footer properties. 

Example of how the ode was cleaned to be easier to read:
``` 
<section class="header">
    <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine         Optimization</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#online-reputation-management">Online Reputation Management</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                        <a href="#social-media-marketing">Social Media Marketing</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
</section>
```

# What Did I learn?
Through this project, I learned the importance of accessiblity. I learned that improving a website can be possible while preserving the original code by adding semantic elements which do not disturb the overall flow of a website. My only challenge through out this project was trying to figure out how to add images to this README. I will have that fixed for my next project.
